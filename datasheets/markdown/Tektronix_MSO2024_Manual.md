2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Preface
This programmer guide provides you with the information required to use
Programmable Interface commands to remotely control your instrument.
The programmer manual is divided into the following major topics:
Getting started. This topic introduces you to the programming information
and provides basic information about setting up your instrument for remote
control.
Command syntax. This topic provides an overview of the command syntax
that you use to communicate with the instrument and other general information
about commands, such as how commands and queries are constructed, how to
enter commands, constructed mnemonics, and argument types.
Command groups. This topic contains all the commands listed in functional
groups. Each group consists of an overview of the commands in that group and
a table that lists all the commands and queries for that group. You can click a
command in the listing to display a detailed description of the command.
Commands listed in alphabetical order. This topic contains all commands
listed in alphabetical order. Command details, syntax, and examples are
provided.
Status and events. This topic discusses the status and event reporting system
for the programming interfaces. This system informs you of certain significant
events that occur within the instrument. Topics that are discussed include
registers, queues, event handling sequences, synchronization methods, and
messages that the instrument might return, including error messages.
Appendices. These topics contain miscellaneous information, such as a list
of reserved words, a table of the factory initialization (default) settings, and
interface specifications that can be helpful when using commands to remotely
control the instrument.

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Getting Started
This manual explains the use of commands to remotely control your instrument.
With this information, you can write computer programs to perform functions,
such as setting the front-panel controls, taking measurements, performing
statistical calculations, and exporting data for use in other programs.
Familiarity with the User Manual for your instrument is assumed. You can
download the User Manual from the Tektronix website at www.tek.com.
NOTE. Most examples in this document assume that both HEADer and VERBose
are set to ON.

Setting Up Remote Communications Hardware
You can remotely control communications between your instrument and a PC
via Ethernet or USB cables.

Ethernet

If you are using Ethernet, start by connecting an appropriate Ethernet cable to the
Ethernet port (RJ-45 connector) on the side of your instrument. This connects the
instrument to a 10BASE-T/100BASE-T/1000BASE-T local area network.
To change the Ethernet settings on your instrument, do the following:
1. Select the Utility drop-down menu.
2. Select the I/O menu.
3. Select the LAN panel.
4. In the menu, if you are on a DHCP Ethernet network that supplies the IP
address automatically by a DHCP, tap Auto.
5. In the menu, if you want to supply your own network settings, tap Manual
to set a hard coded TCP/IP address.

USB

If you are using USB, start by connecting the appropriate USB cable to the USB
2.0 device port on the side of your instrument. This port requires that the cable
connected from the port to the host computer meets the USB 2.0 specification.
Typically, such cables should be 3 feet or shorter in length, but this is determined
by the quality of the cable and, with higher quality cables, this length can be
extended. (It is also dependent upon the drive capability of the host USB port
to which the instrument is connected.) The use of high quality short cables is
recommended to avoid USB connection problems.

Getting Started

With USB, the system automatically configures itself. To verify that the USB is
enabled:
1. Select the Utility drop-down menu.
2. Select the I/O menu.
3. Touch USB Device Port to open the USB Device Port configuration menu.
4. If USB is disabled, tap USB Device Port to enable the USB Device port.
After connection, the host, with appropriate software, can list the instrument as a
USB device with the following parameters: (See Table 1-1.)

Setting Up Remote Communications Software
Connect your instrument directly to a computer to let the PC analyze your data,
collect screen images, or to control the instrument using a program of your own
creation. Three ways to connect your instrument to a computer are through the
VISA drivers, or via a socket server.

Using VISA

VISA lets you use your MS-Windows computer to acquire data from your
instrument for use in an analysis package that runs on your PC, such as Microsoft
Excel, National Instruments LabVIEW, Tektronix OpenChoice Desktop software,
or your own custom software. You can use a common communications
connection, such as USB or Ethernet, to connect the computer to the instrument.
To set up VISA communications between your instrument and a computer:

1-2

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Getting Started

1. Load the VISA drivers on your computer. Also, load your application, such
as OpenChoice Desktop. You will find the drivers and OpenChoice Desktop
software on the appropriate CD that comes with your instrument or at the
Tektronix software finder Web page (www.tektronix.com\downloads).
2. Connect the instrument to your computer with the appropriate USB or
Ethernet cable. Cycle the power on the instrument.
3. Select the Utility drop-down menu
4. Select I/O menu.
5. If you are using USB, the system sets itself up automatically for you, if
USB is enabled. Check USB DEVICE PORT panel to be sure that USB is
enabled. If it is not enabled, toggle the On/Off button to On.
6. To use Ethernet, select the LAN panel. Use the controls to adjust your
network settings, as needed. For more information, see the e*Scope setup
information below.
7. If you want to change socket server parameters, select the Socket Server
panel and enter new values through the resulting panel controls.
8. Run your application software on your computer.

Quick Tips

The USB 2.0 device port is the correct USB port for computer connectivity.
Use the side USB 2.0 host ports to connect your instrument to USB flash
drives, hard drives, keyboards or mice. Use the USB Device port to connect
your instrument to a PC.
There are two USB 2.0 host ports and a USB 2.0 device port on the side of
the instrument. Printers are not supported on host ports. PictBridge printers
are not supported on the device port.

Using a Socket Server

A socket server provides two-way communication over an Internet Protocol-based
computer network. You can use your instrument’s socket server feature to let your
instrument talk to a remote-terminal device or computer.
To set up and use a socket server between your instrument and a remote terminal
or computer:
1. Connect the instrument to your computer network with an appropriate
Ethernet cable.
2. Select the Utility drop-down menu.
3. Select the I/O menu.
4. Tap Socket Server.
5. On the resulting Socket Server panel, tap the top entry to toggle the Socket
Server On.

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Getting Started

6. Choose whether the protocol should be None or Terminal. A communication
session run by a human at a keyboard typically uses a terminal protocol.
An automated session might handle its own communications without using
such a protocol.
7. If required, change the port number by rotating multipurpose knob a.
8. If required, press OK to set the new port number.
9. After setting up the socket server parameters, you can now have the computer
“talk” to the instrument. If you are running an MS Windows PC, you could
run its default client with its command-like interface. One way to do this is
by typing “ Telnet ” in the Run window. The Telnet window will open on
the PC.
NOTE. On MS Windows 10, you must first enable Telnet in order for it to work.
10. Start a terminal session between your computer and your instrument by typing
in an open command with the instrument LAN address and port #. You can
obtain the LAN address by pushing the LAN panel to view the resulting LAN
setting panel. You can obtain the port # by tapping the Socket Server panel
and viewing the Port item.
For example, if the instrument IP address was 123.45.67.89 and the port
# was the default of 4000, you could open a session by writing into the MS
Windows Telnet screen:
open 123.45.67.89 4000

The instrument will send a help screen to the computer when it is done
connecting.
11. You can now type in a standard query, as found in the programmer manual,
such as *idn?
The Telnet session window will respond by displaying a character string
describing your instrument. You can type in more queries and view more
results on this Telnet session window. You can find the syntax for relevant
queries and related status codes in other sections of this manual.
NOTE. Do not use the computer’s backspace key during an MS Windows' Telnet
session with the instrument.
Socket Server Terminal Protocol Mode Commands. Following are Tektronix
Instrument Control Terminal Session Control commands:
!t <timeout> : set the response timeout in milliseconds.
!d : send device clear to the instrument.

1-4

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Getting Started

!r : read response from instrument.
!h : print this usage info.
NOTE. Commands containing a ? are treated as queries, and the responses are
read automatically.

Documentation

Documentation for your instrument is available for download at www.tek.com.

Dynamic programmatic interface
This programmatic interface is dynamic. This means the instrument will not
recognize certain commands until the objects referenced by those commands
actually exist. For example, commands related to measurements are not
recognized until measurements are added. Therefore, the response to a *LRN?
query will not normally include the instrument's complete command set.
The following command groups are not available when the instrument is in its
default state:
Measurement
Math
Bus
Search and Mark
Plot
Adding an instance of one of those components will cause all commands
related to that component to be recognized. For example, sending the
MEASUrement:ADDNew command adds a measurement at which point the
measurement commands will be recognized. Conversely, once all instances of a
component have been deleted, the commands related to that component will no
longer be recognized.

Implicit activation
When you send a command or query related to a dynamic object (such as
Math1, Bus3, or Meas2) to the instrument and that instance does not yet exist,
the instrument:
creates a default instance with the name you specified
adds all relevant commands and queries to the set of recognized commands
responds to the command or query

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

1-5

Getting Started

Example 1

*RST followed by a *LRN? will not return any MATH<x> commands because in
the default state, the instrument does not have any math waveforms. However
querying :MATH:MATH1:DEFinition? will add MATH1 with the default math
expression Ch1 - Ch2. Then the query will return the expected result. Note that if
Ch1 or Ch2 is not active, they will be activated as part of this action. A *LRN
issued after this will return MATH commands in addition to other available
commands.

Example 2

*RST followed by :MEASUrement:MEAS3:TYPE? creates a measurement
named MEAS3 and returns its type. Since the default type is Period, you
will get Period as the response. A *LRN issued after this will return all
MEASUrement:MEAS3 commands in addition to other available commands.
Not all commands in these groups start implicit activation. ADDNew, DELete,
and LIST commands do not result in implicit activation.

Creating, deleting, and listing dynamic instances
You can create a new default instance of a dynamic feature by using the ADDNew
command. For example, :MEASUrement:ADDNew "Meas1" will create a new
measurement named Meas1. Meas1 will be a Period measurement since the
default type for measurements is Period. Note that you can change Meas1 type
to any other supported type using :MEASUrement:MEAS1:TYPE command.
The DELete command deletes the named dynamic instance. For example
:BUS:DELete “B2” will delete a bus named B2 if it exists. You can delete only
one instance at a time. The LIST command returns a list of all dynamic instances
currently in existence. For example, if you have added three measurements named
Meas1, Meas2 and Meas3, :MEASUrement:LIST? returns MEAS1, MEAS2,
MEAS3.

Backwards Compatibility
2 Series MSO instruments have implicit backwards compatibility built
into the command set. Many commands from previous scope generations
can be successfully processed by modern scopes. In particular, the
MSO/DPO5000/7000/70000 command set has been partially migrated to the new
generation. Use the following table to check if a legacy command is supported
and how it will be interpreted by a 2 Series MSO.
The left column indicates the legacy command and the right column indicates
the command that will be executed on a 2 Series MSO. Some functions on the
scope have been simplified, so multiple legacy commands are mapped to a single
modern command.
In addition to these implicit aliases, the 2 Series MSO also contain a PI Translator
feature. This allows users to define custom command processing to improve

Command Syntax
You can control the operations and functions of the instrument through the
Ethernet port or the USB 2.0 device port using commands and queries. The related
topics listed below describe the syntax of these commands and queries. The topics
also describe the conventions that the instrument uses to process them. See the
Command Groups topic in the table of contents for a listing of the commands by
command group, or use the index to locate a specific command.

Backus-Naur Form
Notation

This documentation describes the commands and queries using Backus-Naur
Form (BNF) notation. Refer to the following table for the symbols that are used.
Table 2-1: Symbols for Backus-Naur Form
Symbol
<>

Meaning

=

Is defined as

|

Exclusive OR

Defined element

{}

Group; one element is required

[]
.. .

Optional; can be omitted
Previous element(s) may be repeated

Command and Query Structure
Commands consist of set commands and query commands (usually called
commands and queries). Commands modify instrument settings or tell the
instrument to perform a specific action. Queries cause the instrument to return
data and status information.
Most commands have both a set form and a query form. The query form of the
command differs from the set form by its question mark at the end. For example,
the set command ACQuire:MODe has a query form ACQuire:MODe?. Not all
commands have both a set and a query form. Some commands have set only and
some have query only.

Messages

A command message is a command or query name followed by any information
the instrument needs to execute the command or query. Command messages may
contain five element types, defined in the following table.

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

2-1

Command Syntax

Table 2-2: Command Message Elements

Commands

Symbol

Meaning

<Header>

This is the basic command name. If the header ends with a question
mark, the command is a query. The header may begin with a colon
(:) character. If the command is concatenated with other commands,
the beginning colon is required. Never use the beginning colon with
command headers beginning with a star (*).

<Mnemonic>

This is a header subfunction. Some command headers have only one
mnemonic. If a command header has multiple mnemonics, a colon (:)
character always separates them from each other.

<Argument>

This is a quantity, quality, restriction, or limit associated with the header.
Some commands have no arguments while others have multiple
arguments. A <space> separates arguments from the header. A
<comma> separates arguments from each other.

<Comma>

A single comma is used between arguments of multiple-argument
commands. Optionally, there may be white space characters before
and after the comma.

<Space>

A white space character is used between a command header and the
related argument. Optionally, a white space may consist of multiple
white space characters.

Commands cause the instrument to perform a specific function or change one of
the settings. Commands have the structure:
[:]<Header>[<Space><Argument>[<Comma> <Argument>]...]

A command header consists of one or more mnemonics arranged in a hierarchical
or tree structure. The first mnemonic is the base or root of the tree and each
subsequent mnemonic is a level or branch off the previous one. Commands at a
higher level in the tree may affect those at a lower level. The leading colon (:)
always returns you to the base of the command tree.

2-2

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Command Syntax

Queries

Queries cause the instrument to return status or setting information. Queries
have the structure:
[:]<Header>
[:]<Header>[<Space><Argument> [<Comma><Argument>]...]

You can specify a query command at any level within the command tree unless
otherwise noted. These branch queries return information about all the mnemonics
below the specified branch or level.

Headers

Use the HEADer command to control whether the instrument returns headers as
part of the query response. If header is on, the query response returns command
headers, then formats itself as a valid set command. When header is off, the
response includes only the values. This may make it easier to parse and extract the
information from the response. The table below shows the difference in responses.
Table 2-3: Comparison of Header Off and Header On Responses
Query

Header Off

Header On

TIME?

"14:30:00"

:TIME “14:30:00”

ACQuire:NUMAVg?

100

:ACQUIRE:NUMAVG 100

Clearing the instrument output queue
You can clear the Output Queue and reset the instrument a new command or query
by using the selected Device Clear (DCL) function.

Command Entry
The following rules apply when entering commands:
You can enter commands in upper or lower case.
You can precede any command with white space characters. White space
characters include any combination of the ASCII control characters 00 through
09 and 0B through 20 hexadecimal (0 through 9 and 11 through 32 decimal).
The instrument ignores commands consisting of any combination of white
space characters and line feeds.

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

2-3

Command Syntax

Abbreviating

You can abbreviate many instrument commands. Each command in this
documentation shows the minimum acceptable abbreviations in capitals. For
example, you can enter the command ACQuire:NUMAvg simply as ACQ:NUMA
or acq:numa.
Abbreviation rules may change over time as new instrument models are
introduced. Thus, for the most robust code, use the full spelling.
If you use the HEADer command to have command headers included as part
of query responses, you can further control whether the returned headers are
abbreviated or are full-length with the VERBose command.

Concatenating

You can concatenate any combination of set commands and queries using a
semicolon (;). The instrument executes concatenated commands in the order
received.
When concatenating commands and queries, you must follow these rules:
1. Separate completely different headers by a semicolon and by the beginning
colon on all commands except the first one. For example, the commands
TRIGger:MODe NORMal and ACQuire:NUMAVg 8, can be concatenated
into the following single command:
TRIGger:MODe NORMal;:ACQuire:NUMAVg 8

2. If concatenated commands have headers that differ by only the last mnemonic,
you can abbreviate the second command and eliminate the beginning colon.
For example, you can concatenate the commands ACQuire:MODe ENVelope
and ACQuire:NUMAVg 8 into a single command:
ACQuire:MODe ENVelope; NUMAVg 8

The longer version works equally well:
ACQuire:MODe ENVelope;:ACQuire:NUMAVg 8

3. Never precede a star (*) command with a colon:
ACQuire:STATE 1;*OPC

Any commands that follow will be processed as if the star command was
not there so the commands, ACQuire:MODe ENVelope;*OPC;NUMAVg 8
will set the acquisition mode to envelope and set the number of acquisitions
for averaging to 8.
4. When you concatenate queries, the responses to all the queries are
concatenated into a single response message. For example, if the display
graticule is set to Full and the display style is set to dotsonly, the concatenated
query DISplay:GRAticule?;STYle? will return the following.
If the header is on:
DISPLAY:GRATICULE FULL;:DISPLAY:STYLE DOTSONLY

2-4

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Command Syntax

If the header is off:
FULL;DOTSONLY

1. Set commands and queries may be concatenated in the same message. For
example,
ACQuire:MODe SAMple;NUMAVg?;STATE?

is a valid message that sets the acquisition mode to sample. The message then
queries the number of acquisitions for averaging and the acquisition state.
Concatenated commands and queries are executed in the order received.
Here are some invalid concatenations:
DISPlay:STYle DOTsonly OFF;ACQuire:NUMAVg 8 (no colon before
ACQuire)
DISPlay:GRAticule FULL;:STYle DOTSONLY OFF (extra colon before
STYle.
DISPlay:GRAticule FULL;:*TRG (colon before a star (*) command)

Terminating

This documentation uses <EOM> (End of Message) to represent a message
terminator.
Table 2-4: End of Message Terminator
Symbol

Meaning

<EOM>

Message terminator

The end-of-message terminator must be the END message (EOI asserted
concurrently with the last data byte). The last data byte may be an ASCII line
feed (LF) character.
This instrument does not support ASCII LF only message termination. The
instrument always terminates outgoing messages with LF and EOI.

Constructed Mnemonics
Some header mnemonics specify one of a range of mnemonics. For example,
a channel mnemonic can be CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4, CH5, CH6, CH7, or CH8
depending on the number of FlexChannels in your instrument. You use these
mnemonics in the command just as you do any other mnemonic. For example,
there is a CH1:POSition command, and there is also a CH2:POSition
command. In the command descriptions, this list of choices is abbreviated as
CH<x>.

Bus Mnemonics

Argument Types
Commands use arguments such as enumeration, numeric, quoted string and block.
Each of these arguments are listed in detail below.

Enumeration

Enter these arguments as unquoted text words. Like key words, enumeration
arguments follow the same convention where the portion indicated in uppercase is
required and that in lowercase is optional.
For example: ACQuire:MODe SAMple

Numeric

Many instrument commands require numeric arguments. The syntax shows the
format that the instrument returns in response to a query. This is also the preferred
format when sending the command to the instrument, though any of the formats
will be accepted. This documentation represents these arguments as described
below.

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

2-7

Command Syntax

Symbol

Meaning

<NR1>

Signed integer value

<NR2>

Floating point value without an exponent

<NR3>

Floating point value with an exponent

<bin>

Signed or unsigned integer in binary format

Most numeric arguments will be automatically forced to a valid setting, by either
rounding or truncating, when an invalid number is input, unless otherwise noted
in the command description.

Quoted String

Some commands accept or return data in the form of a quoted string, which is
simply a group of ASCII characters enclosed by a single quote (') or double quote
("). The following is an example of a quoted string: "This is a quoted
string". This documentation represents these arguments as follows:
Table 2-15: Quoted String Argument
Symbol

Meaning

<QString>

Quoted string of ASCII text

A quoted string can include any character defined in the 7-bit ASCII character
set. Follow these rules when you use quoted strings:
1. Use the same type of quote character to open and close the string. For
example: "this is a valid string".
2. You can mix quotation marks within a string as long as you follow the
previous rule. For example: "this is an 'acceptable' string".
3. You can include a quote character within a string by repeating the quote. For
example: "here is a "" mark".
4. Strings can have upper or lower case characters.
5. A carriage return or line feed embedded in a quoted string does not terminate
the string. The return is treated as another character in the string.
6. The maximum length of a quoted string returned from a query is 1000
characters.
Here are some invalid strings:
"Invalid string argument' (quotes are not of the same type)
"test<EOI>" (termination character is embedded in the string)

Block

2-8

Some commands use a block argument form to define a range or type of value,
as defined in the table below.

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Command Syntax

through 255 decimal)

<Block>

A block of data bytes defined as: <Block> ::=
{#<NZDig><Dig>[<Dig>...][<DChar>...]|#0[<DChar>...]<terminator>}

<NZDig> specifies the number of <Dig> elements that follow. Taken together,
the <NZDig> and <Dig> elements form a decimal integer that specifies how
many <DChar> elements follow.

Alias command group
Alias commands allow you to define new commands as a sequence of standard
commands. You might find this useful when repeatedly using the same commands
to perform certain tasks like setting up measurements.
Aliases are similar to macros but do not include the capability to substitute
parameters into alias bodies. The alias mechanism obeys the following rules:
The alias name must consist of a valid IEEE 488.2 message unit, which may
not appear in a message preceded by a colon, comma, or a command or query
program header.
The alias name may not appear in a message followed by program date, a
colon, comma, or question mark.
An alias name must be distinct from any keyword or keyword short form.
An alias name cannot be redefined without first being deleted using one of
the alias deletion functions.
Alias names do not appear in response messages.
The Alias commands are defined in Tektronix Standard Codes and Formats.
Deviations between that standard and what is specified here will be considered
errors unless specifically noted in the command description in this document.

Calibration command group
The Calibration commands provide information about the current state of
instrument calibration and allow you to initiate signal path calibration (SPC).
NOTE. When running SPC through the remote interface, calibration status cannot
be obtained until after the SPC completes, which can take several minutes. Any
remote command that performs an action on the instrument is also disabled until
the SPC is complete.

Cursor command group
Use the commands in the Cursor Command Group to control the cursor display
and readout. You can use these commands to control the setups for each cursor,
such as waveform source, and cursor position.
You can also use the commands to select one of the following cursor functions:
Off. Shuts off the display of all cursors.
Vertical bars. Displays vertical bar cursors, which provide traditional
horizontal unit readouts for Cursor 1 (bar1), Cursor 2 (bar2), the delta
between them, and 1/delta (results in frequency when the horizontal unit is
time). Vertical bars are another name for vertical screen cursors.
Horizontal bars. Displays horizontal bar cursors, which provide traditional
vertical unit readouts for Cursor 1 (bar1), Cursor 2 (bar2), and the delta
between them. Horizontal bars are another name for horizontal screen cursors.
Waveform cursors. Consists of two cursors you can independently assign to a
waveform. Waveform cursors enable you to conveniently measure waveform
amplitude and time at specific points on the waveform. In XY format,
waveform cursors indicate the amplitude position of an XY pair (Ch1 vs Ch2
voltage, where Ch1 is the X axis and Ch2 is the Y axis) relative to the trigger.
Screen cursors. Consist of two pairs of horizontal and vertical bar cursors.
You can use these cursors to indicate an arbitrary position within the
waveform display area. Screen cursors are basically just turning on horizontal
bars and vertical bars at the same time. These cursors have no association
with any waveform, except that they inherit the color of the waveform they
are assigned to.
NOTE. Cursor commands are available once a view has been added.

Display control command group
Display commands can be found in this section as well as the sections of related
components. These commands control general instrument settings, such as the
intensity of the graticule, stacked or overlay display mode, and the fastacq color
palette. Display commands also control how and where waveforms are shown,
their position on screen, and zoom settings applied to the view. For example,
display commands can turn on or off the display of channels or set the selected
source.
Some actions can create a new view which can have its own settings. For example,
adding a histogram will create a new view where the Histogram plot is displayed.
Each view acts as a separate window within the instrument application and can
be rearranged or annotated as desired.
A WaveView is the primary view used for viewing inputs and time-domain signals.
Buses, non-FFT maths, refs, and analog channels are displayed in the WaveView.
A PlotView is used for viewing measurement results and other plotted data. XY
plots and FFTs are shown in individual PlotViews.
Each of these views can have separate settings, zoom, cursors, and annotations.
Display commands which are view specific have a view parameter in
the programmable interface, such as DISPLAY:WAVEView<x>: ... or
DISPLAY:PLOTView<x>: ... Selected source can also be specified on a per-view
basis. The overall selected source is determined by the selected view and the
selected source within that view.
PlotViews and WaveViews have some differences in command syntax due to
differences in view functionality. For example, WaveViews and PlotViews have
a different zoom model. The commands for specifying the zoom reflects these
differences, and different command syntax is available depending on the view.

File system command group
Use the commands in the File System Command Group to help you use the
built-in hard disk drive. You can use the commands to do the following:
List the contents of the current directory
Create and delete directories
Create, copy, read, rename, or delete a file
When using these commands, keep the following points in mind:
File arguments are always enclosed within double quotes:
“C:\MYDIR\TEK00001.SET”
File names follow the MS-DOS format: [DRIVE:][\PATH\]filename
Path separators can be either forward slashes (/) or back slashes (\)
NOTE. Using a back slash as a path separator can produce some unexpected
results, depending on how your controller application treats escaped characters.
Many applications recognize the sequence of a back slash followed by an
alphabetic character as an escaped character, and, as such, interpret that
alphabetic character as a control character. For example, the sequence “\n”
might be interpreted as a newline character; “\t” might be interpreted as a tab
character. To ensure that this interpretation does not occur, you can use double
back slashes. For example, “C:\\testfile.txt”.
Some FILESystem commands can fail because a file has read-only attributes.
You will not be able to delete or replace such files until this attribute is
removed. Refer to the operating system help on file properties for further
information.

Command groups

Math command group
Use the commands in the Math Command Group to create and define math
waveforms. Use the available math functions to define your math waveform.
The math waveform you create depends on sources listed in the math expression.
If you change these sources, the math waveforms you previously defined will be
affected.
Math expressions can be simple, containing no mathematical computation, such
as CH1, which specifies that a waveform shows the signal source of channel 1.
Math expressions can also be complex, consisting of 100 plus characters and
comprising many sources, functions, and operands.
The acquisition of a live waveform can stop for several reasons: You can turn off
the channel, stop the waveform (via Run/Stop from the Horiz/Acq menu), or stop
the trigger (via Run/Stop from the Trig menu). When you turn off the channel,
math continues and data is acquired but is not displayed. When you stop either the
waveform or the trigger, the math calculation stops, and the last math calculation
performed is displayed.
When a live waveform updates or a reference waveform is altered, math
waveforms containing those waveforms as sources are also updated to reflect the
changes. Also, sources must exist but do not need to be displayed to be used in
and to update math waveforms.
NOTE. Math commands are present once a math has been added.

Command groups

Waveform Transfer command group
Use the commands in the Waveform Transfer Command Group to transfer
waveform data points from the instrument. Waveform data points are a collection
of values that define a waveform. One data value usually represents one data point
in the waveform record. When working with envelope waveforms, each data
value is either the minimum or maximum of a min/max pair.
Before you transfer waveform data, you must specify the data format, record
length, and waveform source.
Data formats. Acquired waveform data uses eight or more bits to represent each
data point. The number of bits used depends on the acquisition mode specified
when you acquired the data. Data acquired in SAMple or ENVelope mode uses
eight bits per waveform data point. Data acquired in AVERage mode uses up to
14 bits per point.
The instrument can transfer waveform data in either ASCII or binary format.
You specify the format with the DATa:ENCdg command. The instrument uses
signed, 4 byte integers and floating point values; it does not support unsigned
floating point values.
ASCII data is represented by signed integer or floating point values. An example
ASCII waveform data string can look like this:
CURVE<space>-110,-109,-110,-110,-109,-107,
-109,-107,-106,-105,-103,-100,-97,-90,-84,-80
Use ASCII to obtain more readable and easier to format output than binary.
However, ASCII can require more bytes to send the same values than it does with
binary. This can reduce transmission speeds.
Binary data can be represented by signed integer or floating point values. The
range of the values depends on the byte width specified. When the byte width is
one, signed integer data ranges from -128 to 127, and positive integer values
range from 0 to 255. When the byte width is two, the values range from -32768 to
32767. When a MATH (or REF that came from a MATH) is used, 32-bit floating
point values are used that are four bytes in width.

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

2-69

Command groups

The defined binary formats specify the order in which the bytes are transferred.
The following are the four binary formats:
RIBinary specifies signed integer data-point representation with the most
significant byte transferred first.
SRIBinary is the same as RIBinary except that the byte order is swapped,
meaning that the least significant byte is transferred first. This format is useful
when transferring data to PCs.
RFBinary specifies floating point data-point representation with the most
significant byte transferred first.
SRFBinary is the same as RFBinary except that the byte order is swapped,
meaning that the least significant byte is transferred first. This format is useful
when transferring data to PCs.
Waveform data and record lengths. You can transfer multiple points for each
waveform record. You can transfer a portion of the waveform or you can transfer
the entire record. You can use the DATa:STARt and DATa:STOP commands to
specify the first and last data points of the waveform record.
When transferring data from the instrument, you must specify the first and last
data points in the waveform record. Setting DATa:STARt to 1 and DATa:STOP to
the record length will always return the entire waveform.
Waveform data locations and memory allocation. The DATa:SOUrce command
specifies the waveform source when transferring a waveform from the instrument.
Waveform preamble. Each waveform that you transfer has an associated
waveform preamble that contains information such as the horizontal scale, the
vertical scale, and other settings in effect when the waveform was created. Refer
to the individual WFMOutpre? commands for more information.
Scaling waveform data. Once you transfer the waveform data to the controller,
you can convert the data points into voltage values for analysis using information
from the waveform preamble.

ACQuire:NUMAVg
CURVe?

Arguments

SAMple specifies that the displayed data point value is the first sampled value that

is taken during the acquisition interval. The CURVe? query, depending on sample
rate, will result in either 8 bit or 16 bit data. In case of 8 bit data, the precision is
also 8 bit. However, in case of 16 bit data, 12 bit precision data is zero padded in
lower 4 bits. SAMple is the default mode.
PEAKdetect specifies the display of high-low range of the samples taken from a

single waveform acquisition. The high-low range is displayed as a vertical column
that extends from the highest to the lowest value sampled during the acquisition
interval. PEAKdetect mode can reveal the presence of aliasing or narrow spikes.
HIRes specifies Hi Res mode where the displayed data point value is the
average of all the samples taken during the acquisition interval. This is a form
of averaging, where the average comes from a single waveform acquisition. The
number of samples taken during the acquisition interval determines the number of
data values that compose the average.
AVErage specifies averaging mode, in which the resulting waveform shows an
average of SAMple data points from several separate waveform acquisitions. The
instrument processes the number of waveforms you specify into the acquired
waveform, creating a running exponential average of the input signal. The number
of waveform acquisitions that go into making up the average waveform is set or
queried using the ACQuire:NUMAVg command.
ENVelope specifies envelope mode, where the resulting waveform displays the
range of PEAKdetect from continued waveform acquisitions.

Examples

ACQUIRE:MODE ENVELOPE sets the acquisition mode to display a waveform that
is an envelope of many individual waveform acquisitions.
ACQUIRE:MODE? might return :ACQuire:MODe AVERAGE, indicating that

the displayed waveform is the average of the specified number of waveform
acquisitions.

any accumulated data is discarded. Also, the instrument resets the number of
acquisitions. If the RUN argument is issued while in continuous mode, a reset
occurs and acquired data continues to acquire.
If acquire:stopafter is SEQUENCE, this command leaves the instrument in single
sequence, unlike the run/stop button which takes the instrument out of single
sequence.

DATa:SOUrce is set to one of these traces, the data points represent the digitizing
levels of the IQ data. The IQ data is formatted as pairs of integer values (i.e.
<I>,<Q>,<I>,<Q>,...)

Examples

CURVE? with ASCII encoding, start and stop of 1 and 10 respectively, and a width
set to 1 might return :CURVE 61,62,61,60,60,-59,-59,-58,-58,-59

NOTE. Curve data is transferred from the instrument asynchronously and,
depending upon the length of the curve record, such transfers can require several
seconds to complete. During this time, the instrument will not respond to user
controls. You can interrupt these asynchronous data transfers by sending a
device clear message to the instrument or by interrupting the query with another
command or query. Verify that curve data is completely transferred.
It is recommended that you follow such queries with an *ESR? query and verify
that the error bit returned and, if set, check the event queue to ascertain the
reason for the error. If the error was caused by an interrupted query, then the
asynchronous data transfer had not completed when the *ESR? query was sent.
In this case, you might need increase your program's time-out value to ensure
that all data is transferred and read.

CURVEStream? (Query Only)
This query-only command continuously transfers waveform data from the
instrument as it is acquired.
This command puts the instrument into a streaming data mode, allowing the
controller to receive waveform records as fast as they are acquired. Use the
DATa:SOUrce command to specify the waveform sources. The command
supports all the same data formatting options as the CURVe? command.
Control of the instrument through the user interface or other external clients is
not allowed while in streaming data mode.
The GPIB controller must take the instrument out of this streaming data mode
to terminate the query and allow other input sources to resume communication
with the instrument. The following options are available to transition out of
streaming data mode:
Send a device clear over the bus
Send another command or query to the instrument
Turning the waveform screen display mode off (:DISplay:WAVEform OFF)
may increase waveform throughput during streaming mode.
Using a data encoding of SRIbinary (DATa:ENCdg SRIbinary) may also
increase the waveform throughput since that is the raw native data format of
the oscilloscope.
While in streaming data mode, two extreme conditions can occur.
If the waveform records are being acquired slowly (high resolution),
configure the controller for a long time-out threshold, as the data is not
sent out until each complete record is acquired.
If the waveform records are being acquired rapidly (low resolution), and
the controller is not reading the data off the bus fast enough, the trigger
rate is slowed to allow each waveform to be sent sequentially.

Arguments

INIT initializes the waveform data parameters to their factory defaults except for

DATa:STOP, which isset to the current acquisition record length.
SNAp Sets DATa:STARt and DATa:STOP to match the current waveform cursor
positions of WAVEVIEW1 CURSOR1 if these waveform cursors are currently

it is silently ignored and DATa:STARt and :STOP remain unchanged.

If either of the cursors is outside the record, DATa:STARt and :STOP are set to
nearest values within the record. This will cause DATa:STARt and/or :STOP to
snap to the beginning or end of the record whichever is nearest, and the following
event is set: 500, "Execution warning", "One or both cursors outside of waveform

When :BYT_Nr is 1, the range from 0 through 255. When :BYT_Nr is 2,the
range is from 0 to 65,535. When :BYT_Nr is 4, then the waveform being
queried would return Fast Acquisition Pixmap data (if fast acq is turned on
and data mode is set to pixmap).
RPBinary specifies the positive integer data-point representation, with the

the screen.
The FPBinary argument is only applicable to math waveforms or ref
waveforms saved from math waveforms.
SRIbinary is the same as RIBinary except that the byte order is swapped,

meaning that the least significant byte is transferred first. This format is useful
when transferring data to IBM compatible PCs.
SRPbinary is the same as RPBinary except that the byte order is swapped,

meaning that the least significant byte is transferred first. This format is useful
when transferring data to PCs.
SFPbinary specifies floating point data in IBM PC format. The SFPbinary

Arguments

<NR1> is the first data point that will be transferred, which ranges from 1 to the
record length. Data will be transferred from <NR1> to DATa:STOP or the record
length, whichever is less. If <NR1> is greater than the record length, the last

data point in the record is transferred.
DATa:STARt and DATa:STOP are order independent. When DATa:STOP is
greater than DATa:STARt, the values will be swapped internally for the CURVE?
query.

Examples

DATA:START 10 specifies that the waveform transfer will begin with data point 10.
DATA:START? might return DATA:START 214, indicating that data point 214 is

the first waveform data point that will be transferred.

DATa:STOP
This command sets or queries the last data point that will be transferred when
using the CURVe?? query. This command allows for the transfer of partial
waveforms to the controller.
Changes to the record length value are not automatically reflected in the data:stop
value. As record length is varied, the DATa:STOP value must be explicitly changed
to ensure the entire record is transmitted. In other words, curve results will not
automatically and correctly reflect increases in record length if the distance from
DATa:STARt to DATa:STOP stays smaller than the increased record length.
NOTE. When using the CURVe? command, DATa:STOP is ignored.

greater than the record length, the last data point in the record is returned.

DATa:STARt and DATa:STOP are order independent. When DATa:STOP is less

DISplay:WAVEView<x>:ZOOM:ZOOM<x>:HORizontal:POSition
Sets or queries the horizontal zoom position (of the specified zoom in the specified
Waveform View) of the zoomed waveform or zoom waveform in the display,
around which the zoom waveform displays. It is freely movable around the
acquisition settings (horizontal span). An acquired waveform or reference could
extend off screen. The valid zoom area does not care about the waveform itself,
only the user setting for acquisition.
For example, if horizontal scale is set to 1 second, position to 50, then the
acquisition area will go from -5 s to +5 s. Zoom window 0 will focus on -5 s
and zoom area 100 will focus on +5 s. If the instrument is stopped and the scale
changed to 0.5 s, there will be data off the ends of the display. However, 0% zoom

Arguments

<NR1> is an integer whose minimum and default values are -1 (don't care), and the

maximum is up to 7 (for CAN 2.0) or up to 63 (for ISO CAN FD and Non-ISO
CAN FD).
The maximum is dependent on the number of bytes being matched and the CAN
standard selected. Its value is calculated as [Absolute Maximum] - [Data Match
Size]. For CAN 2.0, the absolute maximum is 8 bytes. For ISO CAN FD and
Non-ISO CAN FD, the absolute maximum is 64 bytes. The minimum data match
size is 1 byte, which produces the ranges listed above. Increasing the data match
size above 1 byte will adjust the range of valid data offset values accordingly.

Examples

TRIGGER:A:BUS:B1:CAN:DATA:OFFSET 5 sets the CAN data offset to 5 bytes.
TRIGGER:A:BUS:B1:CAN:DATA:OFFSET? might return 7, indicating the CAN

data offset is 7 bytes.
If the CAN standard is set for CAN 2.0, and the trigger data size is set to 3, the

WFMOutpre:PT_ORder? (Query Only)
This query-only command specifies whether the source waveform is Fast
Acquisition. A Fast Acquisition waveform is stored as a 500 (vertical) by
1000 (horizontal) point bitmap. Each point represents display intensity for that
screen location. Only CURVe? query functions are allowed on Fast Acquisition
waveforms. When the WFMOutpre:PT_ORder? query returns Row, this indicates
that the source is a Fast Acquisition waveform (and that each of 1000 possible
horizontal columns being transmitted contains 500 vertical points. Note: 500
might vary based on how many channels enabled from same FastAcq group.) and
waveform points are transmitted in the following order: left to right; then top to
bottom.
When the WFMOutpre:PT_ORder? query returns Linear, this indicates that the
source is not a Fast Acquisition waveform (and that each horizontal column being
sent contains only one vertical point). Note that waveform points are transmitted
in the following order: top to bottom, then left to right.

Status and Events
The instrument provides a status and event reporting system for the Ethernet
and USB interfaces. This system informs you of certain significant events that
occur within the instrument.
The instrument status handling system consists of five 8-bit registers and two
queues for each interface. The remaining Status subtopics describe these registers
and components. They also explain how the event handling system operates.

Registers
Overview

The registers in the event handling system fall into two functional groups:
Status Registers contain information about the status of the instrument. They
include the Standard Event Status Register (SESR).
Enable Registers determine whether selected types of events are reported to
the Status Registers and the Event Queue. They include the Device Event
Status Enable Register (DESER), the Event Status Enable Register (ESER),
and the Service Request Enable Register (SRER).

Status Registers

The Standard Event Status Register (SESR) and the Status Byte Register (SBR)
record certain types of events that may occur while the instrument is in use. IEEE
Std 488.2-1987 defines these registers.
Each bit in a Status Register records a particular type of event, such as an
execution error or message available. When an event of a given type occurs, the
instrument sets the bit that represents that type of event to a value of one. (You can
disable bits so that they ignore events and remain at zero. See Enable Registers).
Reading the status registers tells you what types of events have occurred.
The Standard Event Status Register (SESR). The SESR records eight types of
events that can occur within the instrument. Use the *ESR? query to read the
SESR register. Reading the register clears the bits of the register so that the
register can accumulate information about new events.
NOTE. TekVISA applications use SESR bit 6 to respond to any of several events,
including some front panel actions.

is complete. This bit is set when all pending operations

The Status Byte Register (SBR). Records whether output is available in the
Output Queue, whether the instrument requests service, and whether the SESR
has recorded any events.
Use a Serial Poll or the *STB? query to read the contents of the SBR. The bits in
the SBR are set and cleared depending on the contents of the SESR, the Event
Status Enable Register (ESER), and the Output Queue. When you use a Serial
Poll to obtain the SBR, bit 6 is the RQS bit. When you use the *STB? query to
obtain the SBR, bit 6 is the MSS bit. Reading the SBR does not clear the bits.

Enable Registers

DESER, ESER, and SRER allow you to select which events are reported to the
Status Registers and the Event Queue. Each Enable Register acts as a filter to a
Status Register (the DESER also acts as a filter to the Event Queue) and can
prevent information from being recorded in the register or queue.
Each bit in an Enable Register corresponds to a bit in the Status Register it
controls. In order for an event to be reported to a bit in the Status Register, the
corresponding bit in the Enable Register must be set to one. If the bit in the Enable
Register is set to zero, the event is not recorded.
Various commands set the bits in the Enable Registers. The Enable Registers and
the commands used to set them are described below.
The Device Event Status Enable Register (DESER). This register controls which
types of events are reported to the SESR and the Event Queue. The bits in the
DESER correspond to those in the SESR.
Use the DESE command to enable and disable the bits in the DESER. Use the
DESE? query to read the DESER.

Figure 3-3: The Device Event Status Enable Register (DESER)
The Event Status Enable Register (ESER). This register controls which types of
events are summarized by the Event Status Bit (ESB) in the SBR. Use the *ESE
command to set the bits in the ESER. Use the *ESE? query to read it.

Figure 3-4: The Event Status Enable Register (ESER)
The Service Request Enable Register (SRER). This register controls which bits
in the SBR generate a Service Request and are summarized by the Master Status
Summary (MSS) bit.

Status and Events

Use the *SRE command to set the SRER. Use the *SRE? query to read the
register. The RQS bit remains set to one until either the Status Byte Register is
read with a Serial Poll or the MSS bit changes back to a zero.

Figure 3-5: The Service Request Enable Register (SRER)

*PSC Command

The *PSC command controls the Enable Registers contents at power-on. Sending
*PSC 1 sets the Enable Registers at power on as follows:
DESER 255 (equivalent to a DESe 255 command)
ESER 0 (equivalent to an *ESE 0 command)
SRER 0 (equivalent to an *SRE 0 command)
Sending *PSC 0 lets the Enable Registers maintain their values in nonvolatile
memory through a power cycle.
NOTE. To enable the PON (Power On) event to generate a Service Request, send
*PSC 0, use the DESe and *ESE commands to enable PON in the DESER and
ESER, and use the *SRE command to enable bit 5 in the SRER. Subsequent
power-on cycles will generate a Service Request.

Queues
The *PSC command controls the Enable Registers contents at power-on. Sending
*PSC 1 sets the Enable Registers at power on as follows:

Output Queue

The instrument stores query responses in the Output Queue and empties this
queue each time it receives a new command or query message after an <EOM>.
The controller must read a query response before it sends the next command (or
query) or it will lose responses to earlier queries.
CAUTION. When a controller sends a query, an <EOM>, and a second query,
the instrument normally clears the first response and outputs the second while
reporting a Query Error (QYE bit in the ESER) to indicate the lost response. A
fast controller, however, may receive a part or all of the first response as well. To
avoid this situation, the controller should always read the response immediately
after sending any terminated query message or send a DCL (Device Clear) before
sending the second query.

3-4

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Status and Events

Event Queue

The Event Queue stores detailed information on up to 33 events. If than 32
events stack up in the Event Queue, the 32nd event is replaced by event code
350, "Queue Overflow."
Read the Event Queue with the EVENT? query (which returns only the event
number), with the EVMSG? query (which returns the event number and a text
description of the event), or with the ALLEV? query (which returns all the event
numbers along with a description of the event). Reading an event removes it
from the queue.
Before reading an event from the Event Queue, you must use the *ESR? query to
read the summary of the event from the SESR. This makes the events summarized
by the *ESR? read available to the EVENT? and EVMSG? queries, and empties
the SESR.
Reading the SESR erases any events that were summarized by previous *ESR?
reads but not read from the Event Queue. Events that follow an *ESR? read are
put in the Event Queue but are not available until *ESR? is used again.

The following figure shows how to use the status and event handling system. In
the explanation that follows, numbers in parentheses refer to numbers in the figure.

Figure 3-6: Status and Event Handling Process
When an event occurs, a signal is sent to the DESER (1). If that type of event
is enabled in the DESER (that is, if the bit for that event type is set to 1), the
appropriate bit in the SESR is set to one, and the event is recorded in the Event
Queue (2). If the corresponding bit in the ESER is also enabled (3), then the
ESB bit in the SBR is set to one (4).
When output is sent to the Output Queue, the MAV bit in the SBR is set to one (5).
When a bit in the SBR is set to one and the corresponding bit in the SRER
is enabled (6), the MSS bit in the SBR is set to one and a service request is

Synchronization Methods
Overview

Although most commands are completed almost immediately after being received
by the instrument, some commands start a process that requires time. For example,
once a single sequence acquisition command is executed, depending upon the
applied signals and trigger settings, it may take an extended period of time before
the acquisition is complete. Rather than remain idle while the operation is in
process, the instrument will continue processing other commands. This means
that some operations will not be completed in the order that they were sent.
Furthermore, sometimes the result of an operation depends upon the result of an
earlier operation. A first operation must complete before the next one is processed.
In order to handle these situations, the instrument status and event reporting
system allows you to synchronize the operation of the instrument with your
application program, using the Operation Complete function. Note, however,
that only some operations are able to take advantage of this function; a table is
provided below of commands that support this.
The following commands are used to synchronize the instrument functions using
Operation Complete. See examples of how to use these commands later on in
this section:
*OPC — sending the *OPC command will set bit 0 of the SESR (Standard
Events Status Register). The bit will only be set high when all pending operations
that generate an OPC message have finished execution. (The SESR is queried
using *ESR?) The *OPC? query form returns 1 only when all operations have
completed, or a device clear is received.
*WAI — prevents the instrument from executing further commands or queries
until all pending commands that generate an OPC message are complete.
BUSY? — returns the status of operations: 1 means there are pending operations,
0 means that all pending operations are complete.
NOTE. Some OPC operations may require an extended period of time to complete
or may never complete. For example, a single sequence acquisition may never
complete when no trigger event occurs. You should be aware of these conditions
and tailor your program accordingly by:
— setting the timeout sufficiently for the anticipated maximum time for the
operation and
— handle a timeout appropriately by querying the SESR (*ESR?) and event queue
(EVMsg? or ALLEv?).

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

3-7

Status and Events

NOTE. The *OPC command form can also be used to cause an SRQ to be
generated upon completion of all pending operations. This requires that the
ESB (Event Status Bit, bit 5) of the SRER (Service Request Enable Regiser) is set,
and the OPC bit (bit 0) of the DESR (Device Event Status Enable Register) and
the ESER (Event Status Enable Register) are set. (The SRER is set/queried using
*SRE. The DESR is set/queried using DESE. The ESER is set/queried using *ESE.)
Only a subset of instrument operations support the Operation Complete function
(OPC):

For example, a typical application might involve acquiring a single-sequence
waveform and then taking a measurement on the acquired waveform. You could
use the following command sequence to do this:
/** Set up conditional acquisition **/

/** Set up the measurement parameters **/
MEASUREMENT:MEAS1:TYPE AMPLITUDE

The acquisition of the waveform requires extended processing time. It may not
finish before the instrument takes an amplitude measurement (see the following
figure). This can result in an incorrect amplitude value.

Figure 3-7: Command Processing Without Using Synchronization
To ensure the instrument completes waveform acquisition before taking the
measurement on the acquired data, you can synchronize the program using *WAI,
BUSY, *OPC, and *OPC?.

Figure 3-8: Processing Sequence With Synchronization

Example of Using the *OPC
Command

If the corresponding status registers are enabled, the *OPC command sets the
OPC bit in the Standard Event Status Register (SESR) when an operation is
complete. You achieve synchronization by using this command with either a
serial poll or service request handler.
Serial Poll Method: Enable the OPC bit in the Device Event Status Enable
Register (DESER) and the Event Status Enable Register (ESER) using the DESE
and *ESE commands.

(SESR) will be enabled and the Event Status Bit (ESB) in the Status Byte Register
will be enabled.

/* Wait until the acquisition is complete before taking the

While serial poll = 0, keep looping
/* Take amplitude measurement */

This technique requires less bus traffic than did looping on BUSY.
Service Request Method: Enable the OPC bit in the Device Event Status Enable
Register (DESER) and the Event Status Enable Register (ESER) using the DESE
and *ESE commands.
You can also enable service requests by setting the ESB bit in the Service Request

MEASUREMENT:MEAS1:RESUlts:CURRentacq:MEAN?

Example of Using the
*OPC? Query

The *OPC? query places a 1 in the Output Queue once an operation that generates
an OPC message is complete. The *OPC? query does not return until all pending
OPC operations have completed. Therefore, your time-out must be set to a time at
least as long as the longest expected time for the operations to complete.
The same command sequence using the *OPC? query for synchronization looks
like this:
/* Set up single sequence acquisition */
ACQUIRE:STATE OFF
DISPLAY:WAVEVIEW1:CH1:STATE 1
HORIZONTAL:RECORDLENGTH 1000
ACQUIRE:MODE SAMPLE
ACQUIRE:STOPAFTER SEQUENCE
/* Set up the measurement parameters on the channel we’re
about to sequence */
MEASUREMENT:MEAS1:TYPE AMPLITUDE
MEASUREMENT:MEAS1:SOURCE CH1
/* Acquire waveform data */
ACQUIRE:STATE ON
/* Wait until the acquisition is complete before taking the
measurement*/
*OPC?

Wait for read from Output Queue.
/* Take amplitude measurement */
MEASUREMENT:MEAS1:RESUlts:CURRentacq:MEAN?

This is the simplest approach. It requires no status handling or loops. However,
you must set the controller time-out for longer than the acquisition operation.

Status and Events

Example of Using the *WAI
Command

The *WAI command forces completion of previous commands that generate
an OPC message. No commands after the *WAI are processed before the OPC
message(s) are generated
The same command sequence using the *WAI command for synchronization
looks like this:
/* Set up conditional acquisition */
ACQUIRE:STATE OFF
DISPLAY:WAVEVIEW1:CH1:STATE 1
HORIZONTAL:RECORDLENGTH 1000
ACQUIRE:MODE SAMPLE
ACQUIRE:STOPAFTER SEQUENCE
/* Set up the measurement parameters on the channel we’re
about to sequence */
MEASUREMENT:MEAS1:TYPE AMPLITUDE
MEASUREMENT:MEAS1:SOURCE CH1
/* Acquire waveform data */
ACQUIRE:STATE ON
/* Wait until the acquisition is complete before taking
the measurement*/
*/
*WAI
/* Take amplitude measurement */
MEASUREMENT:MEAS1:RESUlts:CURRentacq:MEAN?

The controller can continue to write commands to the input buffer of the
instrument, but the commands will not be processed by the instrument until all
in-process OPC operations are complete. If the input buffer becomes full, the
controller will be unable to write commands to the buffer. This can cause a
time-out.

Example of Using the
BUSY Query

The BUSY? query allows you to find out whether the instrument is busy
processing a command that has an extended processing time such as
single-sequence acquisition.
The same command sequence, using the BUSY? query for synchronization, looks
like this:
/* Set up conditional acquisition */
ACQUIRE:STATE OFF
DISPLAY:WAVEVIEW1:CH1:STATE 1
HORIZONTAL:RECORDLENGTH 1000
ACQUIRE:MODE SAMPLE
ACQUIRE:STOPAFTER SEQUENCE
/* Acquire waveform data */
ACQUIRE:STATE ON
/* Set up the measurement parameters */
MEASUREMENT:IMMED:TYPE AMPLITUDE

3-12

2 Series MSO Programmer Manual

Status and Events

MEASUREMENT:IMMED:SOURCE CH1
/* Wait until the acquisition is complete before taking
the measurement */
While BUSY? keep looping
/* Take amplitude measurement */
MEASUREMENT:IMMED:VALUE?

This sequence lets you create your own wait loop rather than using the *WAI
command. The BUSY? query helps you avoid time-outs caused by writing too
many commands to the input buffer. The controller is still tied up though, and
the repeated BUSY? query will result in bus traffic.

Reference waveforms

Measurements on references also support OPC when used in conjunction with a
:RECALL:WAVEFORM command.
/* Load the waveform file */
:RECALL:WAVEFORM "C:/Digital8.wfm”,REF1
*OPC?
/* Set up the measurement parameters on the reference */
:MEASUrement:MEAS1:TYPE PERIOD
:MEASUrement:MEAS1:SOURCE REF1
*OPC?
/* Wait for read from Output Queue. */
/* Take amplitude measurement */
:MEASUrement:MEAS1:RESUlts:CURRentacq:MEAN?

Messages

The information contained in the topics above covers all the programming
interface messages the instrument generates in response to commands and queries.
For most messages, a secondary message from the instrument gives detail about
the cause of the error or the meaning of the message. This message is part of the
message string and is separated from the main message by a semicolon.
Each message is the result of an event. Each type of event sets a specific bit in the
SESR and is controlled by the equivalent bit in the DESER. Thus, each message
is associated with a specific SESR bit. In the message tables, the associated SESR
bit is specified in the table title, with exceptions noted with the error message text.

No Event

The following table shows the messages when the system has no events or status
to report. These have no associated SESR bit.

Appendix D: Waveform Transfer (WFMOutpre and CURVe
Query) Examples
Here are several examples of command sequences using the WFMOutpre? and
CURVe? queries to transfer data from the instrument to a PC, with different
data sources, including Analog, Digital waveforms. Each command sequence
example is followed by an explanation of the returned WFMOutpre? results.
The WFMOutpre? values act as settings that apply to the CURVe query data
being transferred.
NOTE. In order to guarantee that the waveform data returned from CURVE?
queries of multiple waveforms are correlated to the same acquisition, you should
use single sequence acquisition mode to acquire the waveform data from a single
acquisition. Single sequence acquisition mode is enabled using SEQuence.

Example 1: Analog Waveform (Channels 1–4)
Goal: Transfer 10,000 points of analog channel waveform data from the
instrument to a PC.

WFMOutpre? Query results

Explanation

BYT_NR 1

This value specifies the number of bytes per data point in the waveform data. To change
this value automatically, use the WFMOutpre:BYT_Nr command. Note that changing this
value automatically changes the BIT_NR value accordingly. (This value can also be set
using the command.)

BIT_NR 8

This value specifies the number of bits per data point in the waveform data. To change this
value, use the WFMOutpre:BIT_Nr command. Note that changing this value automatically
changes the BYT_NR value accordingly.

ENCDG BINARY

This value specifies the encoding of the waveform data. To change this value (the other
possibility is ASCii), use the WFMOutpre:ENCdg command. (This value can also be set using
the DATa:ENCdg command, which provides the ability to set the WFMOutpre:ENCdg,
WFMOutpre:BN_Fmt,: and WFMOutpre:BYT_Or values using a single command.)

BN_FMT RI

This value specifies the binary format, which in this case is RI (signed integer). To change
this value (the other possibility is RP or positive integer), use the WFMOutpre:BN_Fmt
command. Note: this field is not applicable for ASCii encoding.

BYT_OR MSB

This value specifies the byte order for the BINARY encoding, which in this case is MSB
(most significant byte first). To change this value to LSB, use the WFMOutpre:BYT_Or

but you also have the option to transfer only a portion of the record length by using the
DATa:STARt and DATa:STOP commands.

PT_FMT Y

This value indicates the format of the data points in the waveform record. In this case,
the value represents YT format. This is query only – the returned values can be Y for YT
format or ENV for envelope format (min/max pairs). (If you would like to determine only this
value, use the WFMOutpre:PT_Fmt? query.)

PT_ORDER LINEAR

This value is LINEAR or ROW.

XUNIT "s"

This value indicates the units of the x-axis of the waveform record. This is determined by the
horizontal settings for the waveform source. Typically, this value is “s”, representing seconds.
When using the math waveform as a source, the value can be “s” or “Hz”. This is query only.
(If you would like to determine only this value, use the WFMOutpre:XUNit? query.)

This value indicates the sub-sample time between the trigger sample (designated by
PT_OFF) and the occurrence of the actual trigger in the waveform record. The value is in
units of WFMOutpre:XUNit. This is query only. (If you would like to determine only this
value, use the WFMOutpre:XZEro? query.)

PT_OFF 5000

This value indicates the data point immediately following the trigger point relative to
DATa:STARt in the waveform record. This is a query only. (If you would like to determine
only this value, use the WFMOutpre:PT_Off? query.)

Equivalent-Time sampling (ET)
A sampling mode in which the instrument acquires signals over many repetitions
of the event. This instrument uses a type of equivalent time sampling called
random equivalent time sampling. It utilizes an internal clock that runs
asynchronously with respect to the input signal and the signal trigger. The
instrument takes samples continuously, independent of the trigger position, and
displays them based on the time difference between the sample and the trigger.
Although the samples are taken sequentially in time, they are random with respect
to the trigger.
Real-Time sampling
A sampling mode where the instrument samples fast enough to completely fill a
waveform record from a single trigger event. Use real-time sampling to capture
single-shot or transient events.
IEEE
An acronym for the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers.
Serial poll
A device on the bus can request service from the Controller by asserting the SRQ
